"Again, we are only boarding passengers seated in Zone 2 at this time. Please check the bottom of the ticket to see which zone you're in." The gate attendant repeats the same message over LaGuardia's PA system as a throng of irritated travelers jostle for position in the line at the gate. Most of these passengers aren't in Zone 2, but eventually the attendants give in and start letting people through. We've been delayed for two hours. They have to get this plane off the ground somehow.

My plane was one of many that was impacted by strong winds on October 17, 2019. I was one of the lucky ones: the flight before mine was cancelled outright, and I wasn't depending on making another connection once I landed in Toronto. Most planes were delayed by at least an hour. Terminal D swelled to accomodate the backlog of passengers with nothing to do but eat 7 dollar snacks and refresh their flight status page.

Things go wrong in the airport all the time. Flights get pushed back for hours or cancelled outright due to poor weather, maintenance issues, or any one of a number of things that can go wrong. Like any system with sufficient scale, it's not *if* something goes wrong, but *when*. Things *will* go wrong, and airports have to deal with the consequences.

One of the most important (and difficult) problems to tackle in this space is how to manage people's expectations. Many people have had their schedules disrupted and want to know why. Even though it doesn't change the outcome, understanding the reason behind a disruption can do a lot to ease the anxiety that goes along with it.

During this trip, I signed up for flight notifications with WestJet. They sent me four emails: one for each time my flight time changed. (Interestingly, I didn't get notified when my gate changed, but I don't think this is the norm.) The emails weren't necessarily *bad*, but they were absolutely devoid of any context. There was no explanation as to why there were delays, no resources for those who are trying to make connecting flights. Just updated arrival/departure times and a token message.

Talk about communicating delays:
- Google: flight WS1210 is delayed which may impact your flight
- Describe the overall cause (pilot on intercom explaining the winds)
- Flight notifications
maintaining order:
- zone boarding
- use of common spaces (seats, bathrooms)
Scalable staffing:
- lines to ask flight attendants the same questions
- too few gate attendants to check people in
