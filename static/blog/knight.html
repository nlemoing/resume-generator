<p>Knights in chess are weird. If you look at every other piece, they&rsquo;re allowed to move according to
some reasonable set of restrictions. Rooks and kings move in cardinal directions. Bishops move along
the diagonals. Queens can do either. To a lesser extend, so can pawns, but they always have to move
forward. If you can accept the fact that certain pieces move in certain ways, then these seem like
the first ones you would come up with.</p>
<p>Knights are&hellip; different. While some pieces, like rooks, bishops and the queen, are unlimited in the
number of squares they can move, none of them can jump over a piece in their path. Furthermore, all other
pieces are restricted to either cardinal (North, South, East, West) or intercardinal (NW, NE, SW, SE)
movements. Knights don&rsquo;t have either of these restrictions: they can jump over other pieces and they
move in an &ldquo;L&rdquo; shape: two squares in a cardinal direction followed by one square in a perpendicular
direction. It&rsquo;s because of this that knights have such a unique role in chess; knights are one of the
first pieces that can be moved (since they can jump over the pieces in front of them), and their unique
movement pattern makes it easy for them to attack multiple pieces at once.</p>
<p>Still, the movement of knights just feels arbitrary. If a knight can move 2 squares, then 1, why not 3
and 1? Or 4 and 2? The knight is one of the oldest and most consistent pieces in history, but it also
feels like the one with which we can do the most experimentation. Let&rsquo;s see what happens to the knight if
we change things up a bit.</p>

<h2>The Generalized Knight</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen how knights move normally: <strong>2</strong> steps in one direction followed by <strong>1</strong> perpendicular
step. 2 and 1 seem fairly arbitrary. We can replace these with pretty much any pair of whole numbers.
Each of these new knights will still have the same &ldquo;L&rdquo;-shaped movement pattern, just with
different distances.</p>
<p>From now on, when we refer to an <strong>(a, b)</strong>-knight, we&rsquo;re referring to a knight that takes <strong>a</strong> steps
in any cardinal direction and then <strong>b</strong> steps in a perpendicular direction.
Using this definition, our original knight was a <strong>(2,1)</strong>-knight.</p>
<h3>Limitations</h3>

<figcaption>For a regular knight, every square is reachable.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A regular knight can eventually reach any square from any other square on any rectangular board, given enough steps.
Therefore, it&rsquo;s more interesting to look at what a knight <em>can&rsquo;t</em> do than what it can. We&rsquo;ll set the knights up to explore
every possible path from their starting position and look for any unreachable area.</p>
