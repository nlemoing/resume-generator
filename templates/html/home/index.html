    <p>
        I've worn a number of different hats over the years: I've worked on websites, distributed backends, cloud infrastructure along with a healthy dose of scripting and spreadsheet work.
        I have a Computer Science degree from the University of Waterloo and worked as a backend/architectural engineer for Noom in New York City for 5 years.
        Prior to that, I worked a number of contract jobs that gave me a large breadth of experience with different teams, technologies and business needs.
        There's a variety of tools in my toolbelt and over the years, I've learned to take the long view; it's not enough for something to work, it has to work reliably and predictably.
        I love digging into a problem deeply and building things that make people's lives easier.
        In my free time, I like to work on exploratory projects based on my own interests, from <a href="https://lemoing.ca/blog/knight">chess</a> to <a href="https://bicyclopedia.lemoing.ca/">bikes</a> to <a href="https://github.com/nlemoing/crossword">crosswords</a>.

        A big part of my life outside of work revolves around sports. My main sports are ultimate frisbee, cycling, and ice hockey (which, in Australia, you have to specify).
        In Australia, I've been able to take my cycling to the next level by working at Venture Cycles, a local bike shop that does a little bit of everything.
        They've been kind enough to let me learn by osmosis (though it sometimes feels like drinking out of a firehose).

        In 2024, I got to marry my best friend Lauren in a small ceremony in Mallorca, Spain. We've had the opportunity to travel to and live in many different countries together, with our latest move being to Australia to be closer to Lauren's mom for 2025.
